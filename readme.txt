Name: Gate Guru

Description: This program allows the user to analyze Logic gates.
The user is able to draw out a schematic using different logic gates 
and wires to visualize which wires are on and off: the wires that are 
on will turn red, and the other wires will remain black. While being 
drawn they will be dashed. They will only turn black if it is connected 
in a valid manner (input to output), otherwise it will disappear on mouse release.

There are also going to be input buttons which the user can click to turn on or off 
the input value. Underneath the input buttons there will be labels so that can be 
used in the expression calculator [described below]

There are basic building blocks like the AND, OR, and NOT, but also the adder and XOR.
hovering over and pressing the space bar on the more complex gates would also allow 
the user to see how they are built, just like in xLogicGates.

In order to visualize the gates there is going to be a power button. 
This way the wires are not lighting up while the user is trying to 
build their schematic. When the power is on the button will turn
into a shutdown button.

When pressed, the expression button opens a new screen with the expression of whatever
is built on the schematic. The user will only be able to use one output component at a given time.

The reset button resets the screen to default settings and clears the work area.


In order to run the program, the user must have cmu_graphics installed


There are no shortcut commands.
